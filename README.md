### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an Information Systems undergraduate at Singapore Management University. I am most passionate about data science, especially, natural language processing and computer vision. Besides that, I would also be very interested in exploring data and software engineering!

ðŸŒ± During my free time, I enjoy reading articles related to sociology, psychology, history, health and fitness. My other hobbies include pilates, barre and running. 

ðŸ“« I am always open to new and exciting opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/siti-salihah-bmr/ if you would like me to contribute to your team!
