### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a recent Information Systems graduate from Singapore Management University. From my past projects and internships, I came to realise that I have a strong interest in data engineering and backend development.

ðŸŒ± During my free time, I enjoy reading about food and different culture/traditions in the world. My other hobbies include strength training, pilates, barre, running and cooking. 

ðŸ“« I am always open to new and exciting opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/siti-salihah-bmr/ if you would like me to contribute to your team!
